# Otter

An ultra-minimalist, always-on-top note-taking app for Windows 11. Built for video note-taking — it floats above every other window so you never lose your place.

## Download

Grab the latest `.exe` from the [Releases](../../releases) page. No installation needed — just double-click and it opens.

> If Windows shows a SmartScreen warning, click **More info → Run anyway**. This is normal for unsigned indie apps.

## Features

- **Always on Top** — floats above every other window, including video players. Click the status text in the bottom-right corner to toggle it on/off whenever you need.
- **Frameless dark UI** — deep charcoal background, rounded corners, no distracting title bar.
- **Rich text formatting** — Bold, Italic, Underline, and Strikethrough via toolbar buttons or `Ctrl+B / I / U`.
- **Adjustable font size** — change it on the fly from the toolbar.
- **Notes sidebar** — click the ≡ button to see all your saved notes and switch between them.
- **Auto-save** — every keystroke is saved automatically after a short pause. No manual saving ever.
- **Plain `.txt` files** — notes are saved to `Documents\WhiplashNotes\` as readable text files you can open in Notepad, VS Code, or any editor.
- **100% offline** — zero cloud, zero analytics, zero external connections.
